            How to Watch A Certain Magical / Scientific (Toaru) Series / Accelerator in order
        </H1>
        <p>
            The Toaru series watch order or A Certain Magical / Scientific is complicated and convoluted with loads of characters and stories. Here’s how to make it a lot easier to start out!
        </p>
        <p>
            Toaru, a famous anime series that involved magic, science, and tons of action, started out with the light novel “A Certain Magical Index” written by Kazuma Kamachi and illustrated by Kiyotaka Haimura. With the popularity of the series, a spin-off was made called “A Certain Scientific Railgun” followed by another spin-off “A Certain Scientific Accelerator.” However, these spin-offs play an integral part to the entire story so they are a must-watch.
        </p>
        <p>
            “A Certain Magical Index” centers around Toma Kamijou, a high-school student in Academy City. In this world, certain people have supernatural abilities powered by either science or magic. People who derive their powers from science and the manipulation of AIM diffusion fields within their bodies are called espers. People who study and practice magic are rightly known as magicians. The plot involves itself with the conflict that arises between science, represented by Academy City, and magic, represented by various Magic Cabals. Toma sees a girl with a white nun uniform climbing into his window who introduces herself as Index, a being who possesses the information of all 103,000 magical grimoires. People from various organizations are chasing her down to retrieve the information and Toma decides to shelter and protect her. The entire series follows their adventures fighting people on both science and magic.
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand how the spin-offs were based, a brief overview of Academy City is needed. Academy City is the most technologically-advanced city in all of Japan, housing an overwhelming percentage of espers. Espers derive their powers from the concept of “Personal Reality” or rejecting the ideals of original physics and manipulating molecules to their will by indulging in their own “reality” and ignoring the reality in front of them. All espers in Academy City are a result of the Power Curriculum Program, which students have to enroll in to become an esper. These espers are ranked by levels with 5 being the highest and 0 being powerless or almost non-existent power. There are only 7 Level 5 espers and these espers are ranked from 1-7 in terms of applicability to research. Toma Kamijou is a Level 0 esper but he does have an ability. In his right arm is a mysterious power called “Imagine Breaker” that can nullify any esper or magical ability.

        <p>
            There are mainly three ways to watch this series. One is the broadcasted order, the pseudo-chronological order, and the true chronological order. The first two orders are equally chosen by first-time watchers but the true chronological order isn’t really done by many other than seasoned watchers.

            *DISCLAIMER: These three shows will be referred to as “Index,” “Railgun,” and “Accelerator” for convenience*

            "A Certain" Series: Broadcast Order
        </H1>
        <p>
            The broadcast order presents Index first. Index was the first to show up in the franchise and provides a good introduction to the Toaru universe. It starts with Toma meeting Index for the first time and is the beginning of the series in terms of how the show was presented and how the light novels were written. However, the two shows are still intertwined because they were broadcast in a way to present an erratic, yet fulfilling, experience.
